finance_documents,What is the recommendation of Apple's Board of Directors?,"Furthermore, according to public reports, the company donated to the Clinton Foundation. Public reports
           indicate that the FBI is investigating or has investigated that organization for possible public corruption. Media
           reports also strongly imply that individuals and corporations may have sought preferential treatment from
           government actors in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation has many
           supporters who would support the company’s donation, but it also has many detractors that would disapprove
           of this type of giving.

           Fuller disclosure would provide enhanced feedback opportunities from which our company could make more
           fruitful decisions. Corporate philanthropy should be transparent to better serve the interests of the shareholders.

The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 5.

Apple already provides detailed information about our core values and our most significant charitable contributions on our
website at apple.com/diversity/creating-opportunities and apple.com/product-red. Apple’s largest charitable contributions,
which are made only following extensive internal vetting and approval from one or more of our executive officers, focus on
some of the most important issues facing our communities today. For example:
    ‰  Apple supports the advancement of education. Apple has joined President Obama’s ConnectED initiative and
       pledged $100 million to bring technology and services into 114 underserved schools across the United States.
       Under this program, we are donating an iPad to every student, a Mac and iPad to every teacher, and an Apple TV to
       every classroom, as well as services and professional development for teachers. There are now more than 50,000
       students learning, creating, and exploring on iPad through our ConnectED commitment, and 96% of those
       students are eligible for a free or reduced-price lunch program.
    ‰  Apple supports health in the fight for an AIDS-free generation. When our customers buy (PRODUCT)RED™ Apple
       products, Apple contributes to the Global Fund to provide counseling, testing, and medical care to those most
       affected by the AIDS epidemic. So far, (PRODUCT)RED has raised over $360 million for the Global Fund, including
       nearly $120 million through Apple.
    ‰  Apple supports inclusion and diversity. Apple has launched a multiyear, $40 million partnership with the Thurgood
       Marshall College Fund.

Levinson in December 2015. None of the members of the
Compensation Committee is or has been an executive officer of Apple, nor did any of them have any relationships requiring
disclosure by Apple under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K. None of Apple’s executive officers served as a director or a

executive officer of which served as a director of Apple or member of the Compensation Committee during 2016.

Any matter intended for the Board, or for any individual member of the Board, should be directed to Apple’s Secretary at
1 Infinite Loop, MS: 301-4GC, Cupertino, California 95014, with a request to forward the communication to the intended
recipient. In general, any shareholder communication delivered to Apple for forwarding to Board members will be
forwarded in accordance with the shareholder’s instructions. However, Apple reserves the right not to forward to Board

Members of the Board who are not also Apple employees (“Non-Employee Directors”) receive compensation for their
service. Mr. Cook, our CEO, does not receive any compensation for his service as a member of the Board. The Compensation
Committee annually reviews the total compensation of our Non-Employee Directors and each element of our Non-
Employee Director compensation program. As part of this process, the Compensation Committee evaluates market data
provided by its independent compensation consulting firm, Pay Governance LLC, and makes a recommendation to the
Board. The Board determines the form and amount of director compensation after reviewing the Compensation
Committee’s recommendation.

Cash Retainers. Non-Employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of $100,000. In 2016, the Chairman of the Board,
Dr. Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $200,000; the Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr.

The Board and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “Nominating Committee”) believe the skills,
qualities, attributes, and experience of our directors provide Apple with business acumen and a diverse range of
perspectives to engage each other and management to address effectively Apple’s evolving needs and represent the best
interests of Apple’s shareholders.

The Nominating Committee considers candidates for director who are recommended by its members, by other Board
members, by shareholders, and by management, as well as those identified by a third-party search firm retained to assist in
identifying and evaluating possible candidates. In evaluating potential nominees to the Board, the Nominating Committee
considers, among other things, independence, character, ability to exercise sound judgment, diversity, age, demonstrated
leadership, skills, including financial literacy, and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. The Nominating
Committee is committed to actively seeking out highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in
the pool from which Board nominees are chosen. The Nominating Committee considers candidates recommended by
shareholders and evaluates them using the same criteria as for other candidates recommended by its members, other
members of the Board, or other persons.

In addition, in 2015, the Board adopted amendments to our bylaws to implement proxy access. A shareholder, or group of
up to 20 shareholders, owning continuously for at least three years shares of Apple stock representing an aggregate of at
least 3% of our outstanding shares, may nominate and include in Apple’s proxy materials director nominees constituting up
to 20% of Apple’s Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in the bylaws. In
December 2016, the Board adopted additional amendments to our bylaws to enhance our proxy access framework and
make it easier for shareholders to nominate proxy access candidates. For example:
    ‰  Apple no longer requires shareholders who nominate a proxy access candidate to recall loaned shares and hold
       them through the annual meeting. Ownership of loaned shares is deemed to continue if the shareholder(s) has the
       power to recall the loaned shares on five business days’ notice.

    ‰  Apple increased the availability of proxy access by limiting the circumstances under which the maximum number
       of proxy access candidates is reduced.","

| 2017 Proxy Statement | 60 under similar circumstances, and give the board of directors discretion as to whether to accept the resignation – potentially
allowing the director to remain on the board indefinitely. Apple believes that our process, which results in automatic
termination of the director’s term, fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to shareholders.

The Board has also shown an ongoing commitment to board refreshment and to having highly qualified directors who
bring diverse perspectives to the Board’s decision-making processes. Through the Board’s robust director nomination and
annual self-evaluation process, two new directors have been added since 2014.

We are committed to ensuring effective, balanced corporate governance while also continually engaging with shareholders.
This is evidenced by Apple’s proactive adoption of proxy access in 2015 and shareholder-favorable enhancements in 2016,
and by the other actions Apple has taken to ensure that shareholders are given a voice, many of which are described in this
Proxy Statement. The Board believes that these objectives are being achieved through Apple’s current governance
processes and that changing our proxy access framework as outlined by the proponent is therefore unnecessary and
unwarranted.

For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 7.

                                                                  Vote Required
           Approval of Proposal No. 7 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by
           proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

                                                              Apple Inc. | 2017 Proxy Statement | 61 Proposal No. 8 – Shareholder Proposal
Apple has been advised that Mr. Jing Zhao, 262 Altadena Circle, Bay Point, CA 94565, who has indicated he is a beneficial
owner of at least $2,000 in market value of Apple’s common stock, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual
Meeting:

                           Shareholder Proposal on Executive Compensation Reform
           Resolved: shareholders recommend that Apple Inc. engage multiple outside independent experts or resources
           from the general public to reform its executive compensation principles and practices.

           Supporting Statement

           According to Apple Notice of 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, “Since 2014, the Compensation Committee
           has engaged the services of Pay Governance LLC,… on matters for which the Compensation Committee is
           responsible.” (p.26).","

The recommendation of Apple's board of directors is to vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and FOR the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. The board also recommends a vote against Proposal No. 7, which is related to shareholder proxy access amendments. The board believes that their current governance processes are effective and that changing their proxy access framework is unnecessary and unwarranted. The vote required for approval of Proposal No. 7 is a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.","{'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf_145': {'source': 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf', 'type': 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf'}, 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf_51': {'source': 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf', 'type': 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf'}, 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf_109': {'source': 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf', 'type': 'Apple 2017 Proxy.pdf'}}",2024-08-27 17:26:37

| 2017 Proxy Statement | 60 under similar circumstances, and give the board of directors discretion as to whether to accept the resignation – potentially
allowing the director to remain on the board indefinitely. Apple believes that our process, which results in automatic
termination of the director’s term, fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to shareholders.

The Board has also shown an ongoing commitment to board refreshment and to having highly qualified directors who
bring diverse perspectives to the Board’s decision-making processes. Through the Board’s robust director nomination and
annual self-evaluation process, two new directors have been added since 2014.

We are committed to ensuring effective, balanced corporate governance while also continually engaging with shareholders.
This is evidenced by Apple’s proactive adoption of proxy access in 2015 and shareholder-favorable enhancements in 2016,
and by the other actions Apple has taken to ensure that shareholders are given a voice, many of which are described in this
Proxy Statement. The Board believes that these objectives are being achieved through Apple’s current governance
processes and that changing our proxy access framework as outlined by the proponent is therefore unnecessary and
unwarranted.

For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 7.

                                                                  Vote Required
           Approval of Proposal No. 7 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by
           proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

Apple has been advised that Mr. Jing Zhao, 262 Altadena Circle, Bay Point, CA 94565, who has indicated he is a beneficial
owner of at least $2,000 in market value of Apple’s common stock, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual

     Our guidance includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the
     uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, expenses that may be incurred in the future. Stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are
     impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. We have provided a
     reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP results included in this presentation. Our fiscal year ends April 30, and numbers are rounded for presentation purposes.

A detailed Management Discussion & Analysis Report forms part of this report is annexed as Annexure-1.
Outlook for 2023-24
In an effort to revive operations, the Company has been continuously rationalising the cost, post suspension of work at UĴarpara plant.
It has reduced the fixed cost including employee cost considerably and continuously working on further reducing its fixed cost. The
accumulated losses of the Company was brought down to Rs.14845.52 Lacs as on 31st March, 2023 as compared to Rs.25218.00 Lacs as on
31st March, 2017. The management is puĴing continuous effort in scouting for tie-ups & Potential investment/strategic partners who can
introduce new products & infuse capital in the company. The Company is considering various measures including alternative use of Fixed
Assets to generate revenue. The particular process has been affected adversely due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation for last two years.
However, the situation is taking a positive turn with recent developments:
¾       The Company has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to extend the Electric Vehicle (EV) domain across the
        border to enhance the production of eco-friendly electric vehicle. However, the project is stalled at the moment due to Notice from
        Government of West Bengal on resumption of UĴarpara Land.
¾       The Company has alternate plans to facilitate and generate additional revenue and realize adequate fund required, aĞer the
        resumption issue is resolved.
Thus, the Company will facilitate and generate additional revenue and realize adequate fund required.
Implication of COVID-19
In view of the outbreak of COVID-19 which has been declared as a pandemic by World Health Organisation and subsequent lockdown
imposed by the Central and State Government(s) in India, the Company is closely monitoring the impact of this pandemic and believes
that there has been no significant adverse impact on its financial position for the financial year ended 31st March, 2023 as its manufacturing
plant located at UĴarpara, West Bengal had already been under “Suspension of Work” prior to imposition of lockdown.

     Our guidance includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the
     uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, expenses that may be incurred in the future. Stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are
     impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. We have provided a
     reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP results included in this presentation. Our fiscal year ends April 30, and numbers are rounded for presentation purposes.

       students are eligible for a free or reduced-price lunch program.
    ‰  Apple supports health in the fight for an AIDS-free generation. When our customers buy (PRODUCT)RED™ Apple
       products, Apple contributes to the Global Fund to provide counseling, testing, and medical care to those most
       affected by the AIDS epidemic. So far, (PRODUCT)RED has raised over $360 million for the Global Fund, including
       nearly $120 million through Apple.
    ‰  Apple supports inclusion and diversity. Apple has launched a multiyear, $40 million partnership with the Thurgood
       Marshall College Fund. The TMCF in turn creates opportunities for students from public and private historically black
       colleges and universities who are pursuing careers in the tech industry. Apple does not just give money to the
       TMCF; we work collaboratively with the fund to advance its goals. For example, Apple hired 33 students from these
       institutions as summer interns in 2016, and as part of the TMCF partnership, also hosted them for a weeklong
       immersion at Apple’s campus several months ahead of time to provide them with a foundation of Apple culture
       and values to help pave the way for a successful experience.

Apple publicly discloses detailed information about the cost and impact of these initiatives on our website.

Apple also supports many other organizations that share our core values, such as American Red Cross, The Conservation
Fund, Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, Mercy Corps, National Center for Women & Information
Technology, National Society of Black Engineers, and World Wildlife Fund. In September 2011, Apple implemented a
matching gifts program where Apple matches employee contributions of money, Apple products, or volunteer time to
eligible nonprofit organizations. In certain cases, Apple matches cash contributions on a 2-for-1 basis, such as in cases of
natural disasters or other major humanitarian crises. Apple has contributed to more than 11,000 different charitable
organizations through this matching gifts program.
Apple believes in leaving the world better than we found it. We actively support our communities through philanthropic
activities. The requested report would do nothing to advance these philanthropic activities, and would provide immaterial
incremental additional information.

There are now more than 50,000 students learning, creating, and exploring

       American heritage.
    ‰  Apple has been working with the National Center for Women & Information Technology for more than a decade,
       and in 2015, we became the first-ever lifetime partner with the NCWIT, expanding a joint commitment to help
       double the talent pool of women available for technology jobs by 2019. This commitment includes a new initiative
       targeted towards giving Latinas the inspiration to explore tech studies and careers.
    ‰  Apple launched a multiyear, $40 million partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. The TMCF in turn
       creates opportunities for students from public and private historically black colleges and universities who are
       pursuing careers in the tech industry. Apple does not just give money to the TMCF; we work collaboratively with
       the fund to advance its goals. For example, Apple hired 33 students from these institutions as summer interns in
       2016, and as part of the TMCF partnership, also hosted them for a weeklong immersion at Apple’s campus several
       months ahead of time to provide them with a foundation of Apple culture and values to help pave the way for a
       successful experience.

Apple publicly discloses information about our inclusion and diversity initiatives and detailed statistics about our progress to
date at apple.com/diversity. As disclosed on this dedicated website, our hiring trends over the last three years show steady
progress in attracting more women and under-represented minorities (defined as groups whose representation in tech has
been historically low — Black, Hispanic, Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander). In addition, Apple is
cultivating diverse leadership and tech talent through on-campus training, events, and programs.
The examples above are evidence of the high level of support from our senior management of our holistic view of inclusion
and diversity.
Our Board shares this commitment to increase diversity. Pursuant to its charter, the Nominating Committee of the Board
actively seeks out highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which Board
nominees are chosen. Our current eight-person Board includes two women and members of diverse ethnic groups.

     Our guidance includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the
     uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, expenses that may be incurred in the future. Stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are
     impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. We have provided a
     reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP results included in this presentation. Our fiscal year ends April 30, and numbers are rounded for presentation purposes.

In addition to the financials presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), this presentation includes non-GAAP financial information. We believe
that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with financial information
presented in accordance with GAAP, may be helpful to investors because it provides
consistency and comparability with past financial performance. There are a number of
limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial metrics versus their nearest GAAP
equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP metrics differently or
may use other metrics to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness
of our non-GAAP financial metrics as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the non-
GAAP financial information with the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP,
and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
